# Clustering_Philippine_Household_Consumption
K-means unsupervised learning on Philippine household consumption data

## Background

I saw a large dataset of household consumption patters in the Philippines, and wondered if the data could easily be clustered.  This is my exploration of that data to see if there were clear trends among food expendatures among households.
